# Introduction

This page will walk through installation and usage of the Airgapped Docs component of Rancher Government Carbide.

## IOC Expectations
As our product is still at Initial Operation Capability (IOC), there are some expectations to level-set:

* Installation and packaging is still in progress and improving.

If you see issues and areas for improvement, please submit Github issues [here](https://github.com/rancherfederal/carbide-charts/issues/).

## What is this?
When in an airgap, having accessibility to documentation can be critical to mission success, especially while troubleshooting problems.

Carbide Airgapped Docs will give Rancher supported users access to documentation for not only Carbide itself, but the entire supported Rancher product porfolio. This includes capabililites like query and copy/paste shortcuts.
