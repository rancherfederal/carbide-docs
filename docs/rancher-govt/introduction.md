# Introduction

## What is Rancher?

Rancher is a complete container management platform for Kubernetes, giving you the tools to successfully run Kubernetes anywhere.

Rancher can provision Kubernetes from a hosted provider, provision baremetal nodes and install Kubernetes onto them, or import existing Kubernetes clusters running anywhere, giving you one place to manage your diverse environment.

Rancher also provides significant value on top of Kubernetes, such as:
- managing cluster lifecycles 
- centralizing authentication and role-based access control (RBAC) for all clusters
- enabling detailed monitoring and alerting
- plugging into existing CI/CD systems, or helping you deploy with Fleet
- and more!
