After adding the Cert Manager repo and installing the CRDs, use the following to create a temporary values.yaml for your chart, subsituting your registry domain:  cat &lt;&lt;EOT &gt; /tmp/values.yaml image: registry: &lt;registry-url&gt; repository: jetstack/cert-manager-controller webhook: image: registry: &lt;registry-url&gt; repository: jetstack/cert-manager-webhook cainjector: image: registry: &lt;registry-url&gt; repository: jetstack/cert-manager-cainjector startupapicheck: image: registry: &lt;registry-url&gt; repository: jetstack/cert-manager-startupapicheck acmesolver: image: registry: &lt;registry-url&gt; repository: jetstack/cert-manager-acmesolver EOT   Then use the following helm install command to use the images:  helm install cert-manager jetstack/cert-manager \\ --namespace cert-manager \\ --create-namespace \\ --version v1.14.4 \\ -f /tmp/values.yaml   ","version":"Next","tagName":"h3"},{"title":"Registry Auth Strategies​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Rancher Configuration","url":"/carbide-docs/docs/registry-docs/configuration/rancher#registry-auth-strategies","content":" ","version":"Next","tagName":"h2"},{"title":"Global Registry (Rancher)​","type":1,"pageTitle":"Rancher Configuration","url":"/carbide-docs/docs/registry-docs/configuration/rancher#global-registry-rancher","content":" Existing Rancher Installations​  Setting a Private Registry with No Credentials as the Default Registry​  Log into Rancher and configure the default administrator password.Click ☰ &gt; Global Settings.Go to the setting called system-default-registry and choose ⋮ &gt; Edit Setting.Change the value to your registry (e.g. registry.yourdomain.com:port).

Products like rke2 are tailor-built to address the &quot;secure by default&quot; needs of the federal government, while still maintaining the same ease of deployments that our users have come to love from Rancher products.  The introduction of Carbide Secured Registry (CSR) marks the next big step we are taking to continually enhance our products emphasis on security, this time by directly addressing the supply chain.  Now, as an alternative to the &quot;upstream&quot; hosted images from Docker Hub, securely built images can now be sourced from the Carbide Secured Registry (CSR), and come with the following enhancements:  Attested build artifacts for core Rancher products (images, sbom's, and vulnerability reports)Securely built on Rancher Government's internally hosted Secure Software Factory (conforming to the DoD Reference Architecture and CNCF Best Practices)  Quantifiably measuring the improvements that Carbide Secured Registry (CSR) provides is difficult considering the early stage of standards around supply chain security. However, initial measurements can be gleaned from the Linux Foundation's SLSA levels.  The Carbide Secured Registry (CSR) was designed from the ground up to build the foundation for the eventual achievement of SLSA 4, or in other words, the most guarantee in a secure software supply chain. Specifically, this means introducing the following capabilities:  Fully defined as code build/release process with signed, non-falsifiable provenanceCustom built, isolated build infrastructure, conforming to best practices such as those defined in the DoD Reference Architecture, and CNCF Best PracticesVerifiable SBOMs and dependency vulnerability reports  It's important to recognize that the Carbide Secured Registry (CSR) has an ever-evolving set of capabilities. As the standards and best practices around software supply chain security evolve, so will Carbide Secured Registry (CSR).  DISCLAIMER: The Secured Registry (rgcrprod.azurecr.us) is not intended to be used as the primary registry for running Kubernetes clusters. It is only intended as the acquisition point to obtain the Carbide secured images. Customers should seed their own private OCI registries, and use that registry for their Kubernetes clusters.  If you see areas for improvement, please submit Github issues here.
